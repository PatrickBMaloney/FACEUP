# FaceUp
An Android app on the An android app on the Vuzix Blade that recognizes faces to revolutionize the healthcare and security industries.Vuzix Blade that uses facial recognition to remind individuals with dementia of who people are.

What it does
FaceUp is an android app developed to connect with the Vuzix Blade wearable smart display and utilize facial recognition technology for a multitude of impact applications in a wide range of fields. By connecting to the Vuzix Blade's wearable camera, the software detects distinct features present in a person's face, and compares those features to a stored library of faces to detect who the person that is present in the shot is. Currently, the app hosts a small collection of faces and is able to distinguish between three different faces by comparing them to stored images. Although simple, the implementation of facial recognition technology in a small, compact, and wearable device unleashes the potential for key impacts that can significantly change the way people approach certain tasks in enterprise, security, exclusive events, emergency and critical conditions, medical, and many more environments. Furthermore, some examples of potential uses include recognizing family and friends for dementia patients and blind individuals, recognizing registered individuals at large events, being alerted of persons of interest in security situations such as an airport or a border crossing, patient profiles for doctors, and much more. As facial recognition technology begins to progress further, the potential for its applications with wearable technology will only grow larger and create more impactful changes.

How we built it
We utilized Unity, Vysor, Vuforia and the Vuzix Blade Developer Center to implement AR into an Android App, and installing the app onto the Vuzix Blade to enable and test out the functionality of the application.

Challenges we ran into
At first, we attempted to use Android Studio to develop the app, however, implementing a facial recognition API proved to be very challenging in a short amount of time. We then switched to Unity as a recommendation by a mentor, which helped save lots of time and achieve the desired functionality.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how much we've been able to learn about android app development and facial recognition technology in such a short period of time, despite not having prior app development experience.

What we learned
We learned about Android Studio, Java, Unity, Vuforia, Vysor, and the Muzix Blade environment.

What's next for FaceUp
After BrickHack, we are looking to improve the facial recognition technology, as well as store a larger database of faces for larger uses, such as a criminal or patient database. As well, we hope to make the interface easier to use and more attractive for the user. Moreover, we hope to add the ability to improve the security of the technology, as the intended use involves personal information of individuals, which must be properly protected.
